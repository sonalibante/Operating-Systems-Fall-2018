There are two files: LRU.c and OPTIMAL.c in this folder containing answer code.

Follow following steps to get the output:
1- download those files in folder and save them in a directry

2- open terminal to exicution, change the directry to the one in which you have saved the code files with command-
 'cd [directery name]' 
(I have used college linux id terminal to run this code, suggested to use the same to ckeck the answer, mail me if you are now able to get the output, I will mail the detailed process.)

3- comple the code with command- 
'gcc LRU.c' 

4- for output use command- ' ./a.out'

 exicute with input frames=3, pages=10, referance string= enter     random string.

5- comple the code with command- 
'gcc OPTIMAL.c' 

6- for output use command- ' ./a.out'

 exicute with input frames=3, pages=10, referance string= enter     random string.

Result-
1) Total Page Faults = 10 for LRU while, Total Page Faults = 9 for OPTIMAL algrithm. this represent the comparison between these two methods. 
2) Till 10 pages both of the algorithms results in same page faults.
3) when page number is greater than 10, page faults in LRU are always greater than page faults in OPTIMAL.
